# [The Apollos Project](https://apollosapp.io)

## Develop

First, run through the [React Native environment setup instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for iOS and Android. **Make sure you're using the React Native CLI section, not Expo.**

Then, start the project!

```
yarn app
```
